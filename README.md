# Data 512A Class Project

## About the Project

The Class Project have four main parts

- Part 1 - [Notebook](/Data512ProjectRepository/DocumentedCode/Part 1 - Common Analysis.ipynb)  Common Analysis sets the stage for the subsequent assignments. In A4 you conduct a base analysis. All of the students in the class will conduct the same analysis, but with a slightly different data subset.
- Part 2 - Extension Plan will require you to ask a human centered data science question that extends the work in A4: Common Analysis. 
- Part 3 - Presentation will require you to give a modified (shorter) PechaKucha presentation of your completed project.
- Part 4 - [Notebook](/DocumentedCode/Part 4 - Data Processing.ipynb) [Annotated R Code](/DocumentedCode/Project Part4 - Regression Analysis.R) Project Repository, creation of a fully documented repository and also requires the submission of a written project report.
